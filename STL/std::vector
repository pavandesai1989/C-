1. dynamic size :
    std::vector solves this: With std::vector, the size of the array can grow or shrink at runtime, allowing you to add or remove elements as needed. This dynamic resizing is essential for many algorithms and applications where data is collected or modified on the fly.

2. Automatic Memory Management
Manual memory management with arrays: In C-style arrays, if you want to dynamically allocate an array of unknown size, you need to manage memory manually using new and delete. This introduces the risk of memory leaks, dangling pointers, or errors in allocation and deallocation.
std::vector handles memory automatically: It internally manages memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring that memory is allocated when the vector grows and properly freed when the vector goes out of scope or is no longer needed.

3. Efficient Resizing and Reallocation

4. Random Access:
Just like arrays, std::vector provides constant-time random access to its elements via the [] operator or the at() method. This allows efficient access to any element by its index.


Summary: Why We Need std::vector
Dynamic sizing: Can grow or shrink at runtime, making it useful for cases where the number of elements isn't known in advance.
Automatic memory management: Avoids manual memory management errors like memory leaks or buffer overflows.
Random access: Provides constant-time access to elements just like arrays.
Efficient resizing: Handles memory efficiently, with amortized constant-time insertion at the end.
Standard algorithms: Integrates seamlessly with C++ STL algorithms.
Versatile operations: Provides rich methods to add, remove, and modify elements.
