In C++, this is a pointer that refers to the current object of a class. It is implicitly passed to all non-static member functions and allows you to access the current object's members (variables and methods).


class MyClass {
public:
    int value;
    void setValue(int value) {
        this->value = value;  // 'this' refers to the current object's 'value'
    }
};

Meaning each object gets its own copy of data members and all objects share a single copy of member functions. 
The ‘this’ pointer is passed as a hidden argument to all nonstatic member function calls and is available as a local variable within the body of all nonstatic functions.+


this pointer can be used in below cases:
When local variable’s name is same as member’s name
To return reference to the calling object
