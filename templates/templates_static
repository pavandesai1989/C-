Function templates and static variables:
Each instantiation of function template has its own copy of local static variables. For example, in the following program there are two instances: void fun(int ) and void fun(double ). So two copies of static variable i exist.



Class templates and static variables:
The rule for class templates is same as function templates
Each instantiation of class template has its own copy of member static variables. For example, in the following program there are two instances Test and Test. So two copies of static variable count exist.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

template <class T> class Test
{
private:
T val;
public:
static int count;
Test()
{
	count++;
}
// some other stuff in class
};

template<class T>
int Test<T>::count = 0;

int main()
{
Test<int> a; // value of count for Test<int> is 1 now
Test<int> b; // value of count for Test<int> is 2 now
Test<double> c; // value of count for Test<double> is 1 now
cout << Test<int>::count << endl; // prints 2
cout << Test<double>::count << endl; //prints 1
	
getchar();
return 0;
}
