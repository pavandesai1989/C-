/*
What is a Lambda Function?

Lambda functions are a kind of anonymous functions in C++. These are mainly used as callbacks in C++. Lambda function is like a normal function i.e.

You can pass arguments to it
It can return the result
But it doesnâ€™t have any name. Its mainly used when we have to create very small functions to pass as a callback to an another API

1.print vector ele using lambda function.
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    vector<int> vec = {1,2,3,4,5};
    std::for_each(vec.begin(),vec.end(),[](const int &ele){
        cout<<ele<<" ";
    });
    cout<<endl;
}
/*
Here,
[] is used to pass the outer scope elements
(int x) shows argument x is passed
*/

2.How to pass outer scope elements inside lambda functions.

Case 1: Using [=]

    [=](int &x) {
        // All outer scope elements has been passed by value
    }
Case 2: Using [&]

    [&](int &x) {
        // All outer scope elements has been passed by reference
    }
    
    vector<int> vec = {1,2,3,4,5};
    int var = 10;
    
    std::for_each(vec.begin(),vec.end(),[&](const int &ele){
        cout<<ele<<" ";
        var = 20;//passed as reference//can be modified
    });
    cout<<"var is "<<var<<endl; //20
    
    int main()
{
    vector<int> vec = {1,2,3,4,5};
    int var = 10;
    int var2 = 90;
    
    std::for_each(vec.begin(),vec.end(),[&var,var2](const int &ele){
        cout<<ele<<" ";
        var = 20;//passed as reference//can be modified
        var2 = 0; //passed by value cannot modify
    });
    cout<<"var is "<<var<<endl; //20
}

3. Capturing Local Variables by value inside Lambda Function
